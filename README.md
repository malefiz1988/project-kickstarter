# Project Kickstarter

Kickstarter is an American public benefit corporation based in New York, that maintains a global crowdfunding platform focused on creativity.
The company's stated mission is to "help bring creative projects to life". As of December 2019, Kickstarter has received more than $4.6 billion in pledges from 17.2 million backers to fund 445,000 projects, such as films, music, stage shows, comics, journalism, video games, technology, publishing, and food-related projects.

People who back Kickstarter projects are offered tangible rewards or experiences in exchange for their pledges. This model traces its roots to subscription model of arts patronage, where artists would go directly to their audiences to fund their work.


This dataset includes kickstarter data from 2009 - 2019 with over 200.000 projects and 37 attributes.

Target of this project: Making correct prediction if campaign will be sucessful or not by use of three different machine learning algorithms. A campaign is successful when the collected amount (=pledged) is the same or greater than the requested amount (=goal).
